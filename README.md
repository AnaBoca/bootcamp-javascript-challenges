# JAVASCRIPT Online Coding Boot Camp Challenges

In these challenges, students worked with complex data structures to solidify object-oriented programming skills -- 
laying the foundation for a software engineering career. The challenges also gave students rigorous preparation 
needed for any technical interview.



## ðŸ§® Celcius to Fahrenheit
* Write a program to convert degrees from [Celcius to Fahrenheit](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-javascript-challenges/blob/master/js-challenges/cel2fah.js)
* Write a program to convert degrees from [Fahrenheit to Celcius](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-javascript-challenges/blob/master/js-challenges/fah2cel.js)


## [ðŸ§® Ordinal Challenge](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-javascript-challenges/blob/master/js-challenges/ordinal_challenge.js)
* Determine the ordinal of a number and display it on the screen


## [ðŸ§® FooBar Challenge](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-javascript-challenges/blob/master/js-challenges/foobar_challenge.js)
* If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Foo", if the number is divisible by 5 then print "Bar" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FooBar"
* Write a program to play the FooBar game and display `n` elements of the FooBar pattern


## [ðŸ§® Build the Join Method](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-javascript-challenges/blob/master/js-challenges/join.js)
The method `_.join` takes an array of values and concatenates them with a comma separator (that's the default, but it can be overridden). Implement this method in JavaScript, starting with the following code as a placeholder:  

```javascript
"use strict";

var _ = {
  // Implements:
  // https://lodash.com/docs#join
  join: (array, separator = ',') => {
    // write code to implement method here
  }
}


const value = _.join(["hello", "goodbye"], ", ")

console.log(value);
```  

## [ðŸ§® Build the Map Method](https://github.com/AnaBoca/bootcamp-javascript-challenges/blob/master/js-challenges/map.js)
Underscore and lodash contain a method called `map`, which operates very similar to the map method in Ruby.  
* Implement this method.
